    <b><span class="text"> Waking up after working a late night can be tricky, becuase you'll most likely want to waste the remainder of your day. How do I manage to be productive after waking up at three in the afternoon, you ask? I just cram all of my obligations into the night. It seems like I'll never get my sleep schedule on track theses days. But who says you must conform to the whole day-time/night-time/ thing? I've gotten to the point in my existence where I have accepted the fact that I just will never be able to enjoy the perks of daytime activities. Yeah, I'm sure I could just bite the bullet and get out of bed and try to do productive things like chores or errands, but I also don't want to feel like throwing my self off of a cliff everytime I have to wake up. So I've just accepted the consequences of sleeping in, and now I just decide to work around it. I mean, if you worked at a bar from 8pm to 2 am, do you really expect to get up at 9am? Of course not. Also, I've realized that the daytime has nothing to offer me anyway! (Although breakfast is my favorite meal.) Everything enjoyable in my life occurs at night, so who even cares about daylight?
